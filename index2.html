             Cook on medium heat till tender enough to mash easily.</li>

            <li>Meanwhile, chop your onions,
             cut your carrots into juliennes and roughly chop your coriander.</li>
             
             <li>Pour the onions into the chicken,stir in and let it cook until translucent.<br>Add the julienned carrots and stir occasionally till slightly cooked.Add in your coriander as garnish.
             Let it cook a bit before turning off the heat.</li>
             
             <li>For the mashed potatoes, add in the butter</li>
